I created a new tmux session named hw04 which is what I used while doing the
homework. It was useful because I stopped doing the homework halfway, and
reopening and attaching to the session brought me right back to where I was. I
did not use any panes, but I did create one more window which I named notes. I
used this window to open up vi when writing the reports for the various parts
of the homework. Doing this in a separate window made it easy to switch back
and forth to copy and paste commands and outputs.

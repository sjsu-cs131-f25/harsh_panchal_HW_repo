# Homework 04

I used tmux as instructed to make a session for homework 4. This allowed me to
leave and exit the vm halfway through my homework and come back later to finish
it without losing my progress. I created a window in the tmux session in order
to write notes in vi for the various report files. The window allowed me to
copy and paste commands and their outputs much faster. I mostly just followed
the instructions and ran the instructed commands. The join command was a bit
tricky for me, I believe this is because I was not specifying to use tabs. I
got it to work in the end however.
